The Address Search component uses partial and related search terms (i.e. “fuzzy logic”) and auto-populated address data to quickly find the address users are looking for when completing an application.

With Unqork’s codeless architecture, enterprise customers can build and run future-proof software applications with accelerated time to value and increased developer productivity by up to 70% by replacing language – legacy code – with data.

Unqork Unveils New Third Party Publisher Program for the Unqork Marketplace

One year after the launch of the first-ever no-code marketplace, the new program features premier application accelerators from EY and Quantiphi

NEW YORK – July 20, 2022 – Unqork, the leading enterprise no-code platform, today released a suite of new features to the Unqork Marketplace, including a new third party publisher program. The Unqork Marketplace is the first-ever no-code marketplace, designed to help users build complex software faster through an extensive library of self-service developer tools, ranging from pre-built software snippets and templates to integrations from over 25 world class partners. By using just the top 5 snippets on the Unqork Marketplace alone, developers have avoided writing 630,000 lines of code, significantly reducing application time to market and freeing developers to work on more complex projects. The latest additions to the Unqork Marketplace include the launch of a third party publisher program and new listings that will provide even more value to users by expanding the Unqork ecosystem and unlocking developer productivity.  

Built entirely on Unqork’s no-code platform, the Unqork Marketplace serves as an innovation hub for developers, providing no-code accelerators that unlock significant time savings for more efficient application builds. Developers have used the Unqork Marketplace to create mission-critical applications – ranging from digital front offices and policy administration applications for insurance carriers to foreign exchange trading platforms and telemedicine applications. 

“Since we first launched the Unqork Marketplace a year ago, users have unlocked significant productivity gains and created some of the most complex, enterprise-grade applications using the accelerators created by Unqork,” Gary Hoberman, CEO and Founder, Unqork. “Now, our partners will be able to create and share their own accelerators directly with the Unqork community, further multiplying the productivity gains for users and opening the door for even more innovation.”

The new updates to the Unqork Marketplace include: 

    Third Party Publisher program: For the first time, third party publishers can launch applications on the Unqork Marketplace, providing developers with expanded access to industry-specific tools that enable increased business agility and innovation. As more publishers add to the library, developers will have access to an extensive library of industry use cases to create complex applications tailored to their individual business needs. Ernst & Young LLP (EY US) and Quantiphi have launched the first application accelerators as part of the program:
        EY has launched two applications to the Unqork Marketplace:
            Add Insurance Now enables private travelers to request an insurance quote and purchase supplemental accident insurance almost instantly. 
            Global Resource Tracker gives business logistics managers a wide-angle view of global resources– from machinery to project architects– at work locations around the world at any given time, critical for effective logistics, resource and financial planning. 
        Quantiphi, an AI-first digital engineering company, has launched Dociphi, an AI-powered document processing application engineered to fast-track end-to-end document workflows, while ensuring regulatory compliance. Dociphi provides routine document workflows, eliminates manual errors and generates insights to prevent fraud for claims processing, commercial lending, mortgage underwriting and more. Dociphi aims to enable insurance workflows and help organizations:
            Process 2x more documents with near-zero errors.
            Reduce document processing costs by over 35% and operating costs by up to 30%.
            Accelerate time to market with prebuilt tools.
    New Marketplace listings, including:
        A Google Calendar integration streamlines merging Google Calendar within Unqork applications to make scheduling appointments on applications like healthcare digital front doors, investor portals and case management systems a seamless experience for the millions of Google Calendar users. 
        The Status Blueprint Accelerator transforms the creation of bespoke status management systems by centralizing and standardizing statuses, actions and checklist items as a dynamic component of a case management application. This expedites status blueprints to be defined in minutes – rather than hours.  

"Quantiphi and Unqork are committed to driving rapid innovation and accelerating time to market across the financial services and insurance industry,” said Bhaskar Kalita, Global Head, Financial Services and Insurance, Quantiphi. “The launch of Quantiphi's AI-powered document processing platform, Dociphi, on the Unqork Marketplace will enable financial organizations to quickly integrate Dociphi into their unique workflows and uncover actionable insights from unstructured data."

Unqork Announces Spring 2022 Platform Update and Expanded Adoption of the Codeless Architecture Standard

An extensive set of new platform features allow enterprises to build better software, faster with no-code while enabling further support for a Codeless Architecture approach

NEW YORK –April 27, 2022 – Unqork, the leading enterprise no-code platform, today announced its Spring 2022 Platform update, the first major platform update of 2022. The new platform capabilities deepen the existing benefits for developers building on Unqork, while also supporting Codeless Architecture, an open-standard approach to software development that allows organizations to build and run applications without ever thinking about the underlying code. 

As enterprises continue to transform, they are often forced to choose between temporarily slowing - or even stopping - some portion of daily operations while they modernize applications, or continuing with business-as-usual until applications reach their end-of-life and must be addressed. Codeless Architecture frees companies from this choice, allowing them to build new applications that are compatible with their existing technologies, whether that be legacy code including low-code or siloed tools. This approach to modernization allows enterprises to build new software and realize the full potential of their existing applications – all without generating or seeing a single line of code. 

With a Codeless Architecture, companies can: 

    Take a best-of-breed approach to innovation with a single source of truth for customer IP that is transparent and portable. 
    Build an integrated ecosystem for their tech vendors of choice by unifying disparate applications.
    Orchestrate complex business processes by automating in-depth workflows and manage complex routing logic.
    Deliver branded digital experiences at scale for a seamless user experience.

The Codeless Architecture approach was born out of Unqork’s no-code platform and the ability it gives customers to build mission-critical, complex applications without writing code. As more and more customers pursue a codeless approach, Unqork has unveiled a new set of updates to the platform that make it easier than ever for users to build complex applications by leveraging a robust set of codeless components. 

Unqork’s Spring 2022 Platform Updates include:

    An enhanced Grid System that allows users to easily access, visualize and interact with their data at-scale. The intuitive configuration experience will enable customers to build Dynamic, Uniform and Freeform grids from the ground up, giving them the ability to quickly analyze data, optimize style and design flexibility and create bespoke layouts for data exploration at scale. The Grid System supports a wide variety of use cases like business logic and validation, simple or complex data entry, dashboards and data exploration.
        The Grid System will also be available to users via listings in the Unqork Marketplace - Grid Syntax Targeting & Output Types and Dynamic Index - which are foundational in helping users understand how to best leverage the grid system in their application builds.  

    The new Enterprise View provides users with a comprehensive overview of their Unqork environment. A suite of dashboards provides users with a holistic view of the health, progress and risk points of each application they’ve built, helping users monitor development progress and identify and address any vulnerabilities. Built entirely on Unqork’s codeless platform, Enterprise View makes it easy for stakeholders across the enterprise - both technical and non-technical - to understand the health of their environment and the overall efficiency of the development process, thus ensuring that higher-quality applications are delivered to the end-user.

Expanding the first no-code Marketplace 

Along with the platform updates, Unqork has released new listings to the Unqork Marketplace that enhance developer productivity and support a codeless environment, including: 

    A Google Translate integration that users can easily configure, giving apps built on Unqork the ability to leverage Google Translate to convert text from one language into another. (View Listing)
    A Webhook API Snippet to help Unqork users expedite the configuration of a standardized webhook in Unqork, ultimately saving users an average of 5 hours in application builds. This snippet was created in record time - less than two weeks - in response to user interest in this functionality. (View Listing)
    A “For Loop” Snippet that allows a user to perform a looping action over a large set of data. This snippet helps users save hours in application builds compared to traditional code, for use cases like validating addresses or updating multiple submissions at once. It has quickly become the #1 listing in the Marketplace. (View Listing)

“As a former Fortune 50 CIO, I know that leading enterprises want technology that just works for their business but the reality they face is much messier–multiple tabs, multiple tools, disconnected data and a jungle of legacy code that results in a lousy customer and employee experience,” said Gary Hoberman, CEO and founder, Unqork. “Codeless Architecture allows Unqork’s customers to modernize their business without disrupting it by giving that existing legacy mess a single, clean and modern interface, while still allowing them to create new applications faster and at a lower cost than using code to drive their business forward. All of these features further that mission to give our customers a better way to build and manage software with no-code.”

New integrations with Uber Health, Workpath, Infermedica and Ribbon Health open up the Unqork Marketplace to healthcare customers

NEW YORK – November 2, 2021 – Unqork, the leading enterprise no-code platform, today announced the launch of a new suite of healthcare integrations in the Unqork Marketplace, the first no-code marketplace. Pre-built integrations with Uber Health, Workpath, Ribbon Health and Infermedica will be accessible via the Unqork Marketplace as part of an extensive library of no-code assets that can be used to jumpstart healthcare projects and build enterprise software faster, at a higher quality and a lower cost than methods that depend on coding. As the first set of accelerators in the Unqork Marketplace designed specifically for healthcare customers, this launch opens the door for health plans, life sciences companies and providers to reap the benefits of the Unqork Marketplace. 

“The pandemic has placed a spotlight on the direct link between software and patient care, demonstrating the necessity of digital capabilities for healthcare organizations,” said Kara Dennis, Head of Healthcare, Unqork. “These new integrations connect Unqork’s customers with leading health technology and services, allowing them to maximize the potential of Unqork’s no-code platform to build best-in-class digital experiences. These solutions enhance a healthcare companies’ ability to modernize patient and member experiences, and to optimize internal workflows.” 

Supporting at-home and on-site patient care

For healthcare organizations using Unqork to modernize member and patient experiences, the Uber Health and Workpath integrations provide essential capabilities for supporting on-site and at-home patient care, respectively. 

    Uber Health’s HIPAA-enabled solutions support healthcare organizations by providing access to stress-free transportation for those they care for. By integrating with the Uber Health platform, Unqork customers will be able to efficiently configure an administrative interface for requesting and managing rides. Leveraging Uber Health, Unqork customers can (a) help their patients get to and from critical office visits, supporting patient retention and adherence to care plans; and (b) help study participants get to study sites, increasing the likelihood of attendance with a tech-forward approach. 
    Workpath enables healthcare companies to provide on-demand, in-home services by dispatching healthcare professionals to a patient’s home from the company’s nationwide network. The Workpath integration allows Unqork’s customers to quickly configure scheduling capabilities directly in their applications. With Workpath’s API, patients benefit from a white-labeled experience that allows them to provide their information, schedule an at-home visit at their convenience, receive confirmation and real-time notifications, and communicate with healthcare professionals.

These integrations support clinical trial enrollment and onboarding for life sciences companies, and enable enhanced member and patient services for payers and providers. 

Enhancing member services

For health plans, providing modern, unified digital experiences for members has become essential. With Unqork, health plans can build prospect portals, member onboarding, and other member experiences with a wide array of self-service tools and health management recommendations, including: 

    Infermedica’s medical guidance platform for pre-diagnosis and triage. Infermedica combines the latest clinical evidence with advanced machine learning to help patients and providers make important healthcare decisions with confidence. With the Infermedica integration, health plans can enhance their member experience with digital front door tools for improved diagnostic accuracy and triage guidance.
    Ribbon Health’s healthcare data platform provides critical infrastructure that payers, providers, and digital health solutions can use to enable accurate provider directories, reliable referral management, and efficient care navigation. Through the Ribbon Health integration, Unqork’s customers can connect their member experiences with a provider database, giving members the ability to query for in-network doctors and filter to find the best fit for their criteria.

Connecting private networks enables Unqork Private Cloud use cases that span multiple cloud regions and even an enterprise data center when customers combine PrivateLinks with on-prem connections like AWS Direct Connect and Azure Express Route. The release also introduces industry-first features like a new Testing Tool to streamline testing across cross-functional stakeholders, a new Grid System for aggregating, organizing, presenting, and easy editing of data, a Parallel Execution feature to support simultaneous business processes and a new Discovery Hub for developers and business users to track, prioritize, and measure ROI of all projects.

The core value-prop, an enterprise no-code platform that enables you to bring higher-quality software to market faster, is enhanced by a focus on enterprise-grade security and features like testing and ROI measurement that ensure your technology is driving the business forward.

Best in Class Cloud Security 

Unqork Private Cloud is an enhanced security infrastructure that allows customers to pass data securely between Unqork and their private resources, without ever leaving their private network and traversing the public internet. Unqork Private Cloud works through PrivateLink with AWS and Azure clouds, providing the world’s top businesses with enhanced cloud security while maintaining the cloud-agnostic flexibility of Unqork. Unqork Private Cloud effectively provides integration with private resources and avoids the need for new endpoints on the public internet, enhancing overall cloud security and unlocking more application use cases. Customers using Unqork Private Cloud also benefit from improved application performance, by keeping communication within the same region and through the same cloud provider’s private network. 

The security benefits of Unqork Private Cloud are built upon the already-enhanced security profile of applications built in Unqork’s no-code platform, which benefit from significantly higher-quality than applications that rely on writing code. 

Unified Testing from a Single Dashboard

Unqork’s new Testing Tool provides a central, streamlined dashboard for users across an enterprise to initiate, track and automate testing. Within many enterprises, testing is a segmented process, spread across different teams (e.g AppDev, QA, DevOps), leading to inconsistencies or redundancies, with vulnerabilities sometimes going undetected. Unqork’s new Testing Tool brings all testing information into one central dashboard, allowing for enhanced visibility and coordination, resulting in higher-quality applications. The Testing Tool tracks all tests and outcomes, and allows for tests to be run automatically and simultaneously. Impacted teams are automatically notified of any status changes or test failures, so they can quickly address issues and be aware of any interdependencies with their colleagues. 

Do More With Enterprise Data

Unqork’s new Grid System provides customers with new tools to build rich interfaces, manage and present data, and enable new workloads. Unqork’s Grid System quickly aggregates high-volumes of data from multiple sources, storing everything in a central repository, enabling end-users to analyze data and surface insights faster than ever before. Previously, businesses were limited to manually entering data into static spreadsheets. The grid system is dynamic, meaning users can embed any Unqork component such as buttons or logic to run critical business processes. Deeply integrated with Unqork’s component ecosystem, developers can even build new workflows on top of the Grid System, allowing developers to not only build new UX and UI patterns but also service bespoke business requirements faster than ever before.

Additional 2021.10 Updates 

2021.10 also includes Unqork’s new Discovery Hub, a central location where developers and business users can collaborate alongside one another to track, prioritize, and measure ROI for ongoing projects, and a new Parallel Execution feature, which gives developers the ability to create workflows that support simultaneous automated processes.

Unqork Announces A P&C Product Launcher Application For Insurance Carriers to Automate the Underwriting Process With No-Code 

Customizable, out-of-the-box solution allows carriers to launch new products rapidly and digitize every step of the underwriting process, from intake to bind via a single, integrated platform

NEW YORK – October 4, 2021 – Unqork, the leading enterprise no-code platform, today announced its P&C Product Launcher application to help carriers digitize and automate every step in the underwriting process. Unqork’s application helps carriers break away from the inefficiencies of outdated, manual systems, enabling them to quickly build and launch software without writing or creating a single line of code. As a result, carriers are able to accelerate new product launches, save valuable resources and provide better user experiences for brokers and customers. 

Underwriting processes are foundational for every carrier, yet many use inefficient systems that rely on legacy architecture. These inflexible underwriting systems significantly hinder a carrier’s ability to launch products and update existing ones. Too often, underwriters must work across multiple disconnected systems, which leads to high error rates, slow quote turnaround times, and leaves customers and brokers with a poor user experience. The complexity and costliness of maintaining outdated systems stifles any innovation teams’ ability to make product improvements.

The Unqork P&C Product Launcher helps carriers create an efficient, streamlined and easy-to-use broker portal and underwriter workbench in one integrated platform. The solution offers configurable templates for every step in the underwriting process, from first customer contact, through the application process, all the way to policy delivery. The P&C Product Launcher also includes 70+ pre-built integrations with third-party services, including everything from data enrichment to policy admin systems.

By leveraging Unqork’s enterprise no-code platform, carriers can launch products in as little as 12 weeks that would otherwise take 18 - 24 months to bring to market. With a streamlined, easy-to-use platform, underwriters can focus their time on the highest-value activities: identifying, structuring, pricing, and negotiating the best policies to support top and bottom-line growth for the organization.

With Unqork’s P&C Product Launcher carriers can:

    Pixel-perfect UI: Customize the user experience to precisely meet a carrier’s brand guidelines 
    Multi-party engagement: Create broker- or client-led intake and self-service workflows that are directly connected to the underwriting workstation for a seamless underwriting experience
    Streamlined integrations: Leverage integrations with leading insurtechs and data providers, including Dun & Bradstreet’s Company Entity Resolution, DocuSign eSignature and others to accelerate intake, automate clearance, digitize rating, and streamline quote, binder, and policy issuance
    Digital dynamic workflows: Orchestrate dynamic workflows including assignment, registration, referrals, modeling requests, etc. across multiple products and geographies
    Transparency and accountability: Manage ownership with automated routing, alerts, and notifications

By implementing Unqork P&C Product Launcher carriers can: 

    Accelerate product launches: Launch new products in 12 weeks with streamlined product development, automated intake, and a built-in underwriter workstation
    Increase underwriter capacity: Automate manual tasks and streamline the underwriting process to free up underwriters to focus on new business opportunities
    Reduce operational risk: Automate manual processes, incorporating built-in approval controls, and maintaining an audit trail
    Improve customer & agent satisfaction: Enhance client, agent/broker, and underwriter experiences through modern UI and self-service capabilities

“Underwriting is one of the most foundational and essential processes for insurance carriers, yet most carriers still rely on inflexible, code-based legacy systems or manual processes that are expensive to build and maintain and create significant workload implications for key underwriting staff,” said Farooq Sheikh, Insurance Go-To-Market Lead, Unqork. “Unqork’s P&C Product Launcher leverages the best of Unqork’s no-code platform, providing carriers with a one-stop-shop for digitizing and automating the entire underwriting process. This is a game-changer for carriers, allowing them to simultaneously free up time and budget resources while providing higher-quality, future-proof software.” 

Unqork’s P&C Product Launcher application is the latest in an extensive suite of capabilities that Unqork offers its customers in insurance. Customers across P&C consumer, commercial, life, annuities, retirement, accident, group benefits and specialty insurance, with carriers, distributors and brokers use the Unqork platform for everything from policy and claims administration to underwriting to servicing, operations and customer service.

Unqork’s Enterprise No-Code Platform to be Incorporated in Kennesaw State University's FinTech Curriculum

Next generation of software engineers will learn through hands-on experience building enterprise-grade applications with no-code on Unqork

NEW YORK – September 21, 2021 –Today, Unqork, the leading enterprise no-code platform, announced it has entered into an agreement with Kennesaw State University (KSU) to use Unqork’s no-code platform in the classroom as part of KSU’s FinTech program which is part of the Georgia Fintech Academy diversity workforce initiative. By adding Unqork to the curriculum, KSU students will have the opportunity to learn through experimentation, allowing them to conceptualize and then create enterprise-grade software solutions -- all without writing a single line of code.

To start, the Unqork platform will be incorporated into the curriculum for one of the core courses in the FinTech minor, Digital Payments Security, which is also taught to students throughout the University System of Georgia. Students will get to experience every stage of the enterprise-software development lifecycle, taking their ideas from a concept all the way to production. Over time, KSU plans to increasingly include the Unqork platform into a wider curriculum across FinTech courses.  

This approach is a natural fit for KSU, which has built a FinTech program that values experiential learning opportunities throughout its curriculum and delivers the Digital Payments courses for the Georgia Fintech Academy. KSU students are able to work alongside industry leaders and partners like the Georgia Fintech Academy to gain real-world experience. 

“The Georgia Fintech Academy is excited to launch four digital payments courses instructed by Kennesaw State University,” said Tommy Marshall, Executive Director at the Georgia Fintech Academy of the University System of Georgia. “The opportunity students have to engage the Unqork platform to create payment prototypes is unique and powerful.”

By removing coding as a barrier to software development, Unqork helps expand the pool of individuals who can be involved in the software development process. KSU has already seen the positive impact this can have - enrollment for this fall’s Digital Payments Security course has broadened beyond Computer Science majors, to include students from a wide variety of majors. 

Unqork was designed specifically for highly-regulated industries like financial services, where it helps customers get to market faster while enhancing quality and lowering costs for development and maintenance. As enterprises face increasing pressure to digitize, more and more enterprises are turning to no-code for their software development. Gartner estimates that by 2024, low-code and no-code software will be responsible for more than 65% of application development activity. For the next generation of software developers, knowing how to use a platform like Unqork is an essential skill that will offer them a competitive edge in the job market. 

“Kennesaw State University values student success, which is visible in our commitment to enhancing applied learning opportunities for our students,” said Dr. Khawaja Saeed, Chair of the Department of Information Systems and Security at KSU. “The partnership with Unqork enables us to integrate innovative fintech curriculum offered through the Department of Information Systems and Security at the Coles College of Business with hands-on experience on the leading enterprise no-code platform. Unqork’s platform democratizes application development which aligns with our objectives of making the fintech space accessible to students with diverse interests and backgrounds. We are excited that through this collaboration, students will not only design and develop innovative solutions, but also test them in a real world environment.” 

“This collaboration offers various career opportunities for our students, which at the end of the day is a major source of motivation for us as an institution,” said Humayun Zafar, Fintech Program Coordinator and Professor of Information Security and Assurance at KSU.

“Knowing how to use Unqork’s no-code platform opens so many doors for young graduates,” said Rabih Ramadi, Head of Financial Services and Insurance, Unqork. “We highly admire Kennesaw State University’s innovative approach to experiential learning. We are excited to partner with them on this new initiative, and help arm their students with the knowledge and skills that will help them excel in the world of software development.”

Unqork Partners with Indelible Solutions to Bring Program Management Expertise to Public Sector Customers

The partnership will combine the power of Unqork’s enterprise no-code platform with Indelible’s end-to-end program management expertise

NEW YORK – September 10, 2021 – Today, Unqork, the leading enterprise no-code platform, announced it has entered into a partnership with Indelible Solutions, a national management consulting and advisory firm. Through the partnership, Unqork’s customers will benefit from Indelible’s expertise in grants administration, case management and community engagement, allowing them to maximize the potential of software built using Unqork’s no-code platform. The partnership will address a variety of use cases across the public sector, beginning with an effort to help states administer the U.S. Treasury’s Homeowner Assistance Fund (HAF), which provides up to $9.96 billion to support the country’s most vulnerable homeowners. 

The partnership will help tackle many of the challenges that public sector agencies often face in launching new software and public initiatives. Unqork’s no-code platform allows its public sector customers to accelerate the development of complex, mission-critical applications, helping them launch new, high-quality software faster and at lower cost than methods that rely on coding. With Indelible’s end-to-end program management expertise, customers will maximize the potential of new products and ensure that the initiatives are reaching residents in need of support. 

To streamline and accelerate HAF distribution, Indelible and Unqork will offer comprehensive program administration, community outreach and application review to ensure benefits are rapidly deployed to eligible residents. Through a custom application, states will be able to quickly validate identity, residence, income and financial relief sought, all in a detailed case review interface. This solution easily integrates with the ecosystem of mortgage lenders, all while staying compliant with the U.S. Treasury Monthly and Quarterly Reporting requirements and other funding sources. 

Indelible, a minority-owned, Florida-based firm, has the expertise and knowledge to help ensure that housing assistance funds are directed to where they’re most needed. Indelible has engaged with Miami-Dade County to support the administration of Emergency Rental Assistance Program (ERAP) funds for tenants and landlords whose incomes have been devastated by COVID-19, where distribution of rent relief funds outpaced surrounding areas in Florida. 

“By combining Unqork's no-code software with Indelible’s industry-leading consulting, outreach, and project management expertise, we’ve unlocked a powerful partnership that can deliver the technology and support that our public sector customers need to launch new products quickly and at-scale,” said Theresa Ward, Head of State and Local, Unqork. “We look forward to working with Indelible, starting with our efforts around Homeowner Assistance, where our partnership will help states bring relief to those who need it most.” 

“We are excited about the partnership we’ve developed with Unqork,” said Mikhail Scott, Director of Governmental and Corporate Relations with Indelible. “Reports across the country reflect a disparity in effectively deploying relief funds with programs like Emergency Rental Assistance and other benefits initiatives. We understand that there is no cookie-cutter approach to this process. Combining our team’s understanding of case management and community outreach with Unqork’s no-code platform will allow us to provide equitable solutions that are tailored and designed for the communities that we serve.”

Unqork’s Rapid Growth Continues in the First Half of 2021

Enterprise no-code leader sees headcount increase 74%, total revenue 277% YoY as the company adds key roles to leadership team

NEW YORK – July 14, 2021 – Unqork, the leading enterprise no-code platform, has continued to experience a period of rapid growth in the first half of 2021, hitting several momentum benchmarks while adding Chief Revenue Officer Philip Lacor, General Counsel Lori Hoberman, Chief Information Security Officer Marcos Christodonte II, and launching the Unqork Marketplace, the first-ever no-code marketplace.

As leading businesses and government entities increasingly turn to Unqork’s enterprise no-code platform, the company has invested to meet demand. Unqork’s headcount surpassed 500 in Q2, a YoY increase of more than 70% and more than double the headcount the company had at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in the spring of 2020. Unqork is also expanding its workforce globally, to meet the growing demand for Unqork’s platform from customers in EMEA and APAC.  

Unqork’s total revenue increased 277% YoY in Q1, and Unqork has more than doubled its customer base in the same window. Unqork is rapidly expanding its robust partner ecosystem, adding 37 new solutions and technology partners in the first half of 2021, accelerating the adoption of Unqork across its core industry verticals. 

“Unqork’s continued growth is driving a question in enterprise software, are you still creating legacy or are you using Unqork?” said Gary Hoberman, founder and CEO, Unqork. “Every line of code becomes legacy the second it goes live and somebody has to be responsible for maintaining it. As the complexity and volume of software increases, that burden piles up on software engineers. Unqork's unique no-code approach makes it the only enterprise application development platform that ends legacy while allowing customers to bring solutions to market faster, at a lower cost of ownership and a higher quality.”

Unqork’s ongoing growth is a result of the unique value proposition its enterprise no-code platform offers to organizations in every industry: a no-code approach to software development that brings mission-critical applications to market faster, at a lower cost and at a significantly higher quality than methods that depend on writing code. Particularly, the maintenance and patching burden that legacy code requires keeps software engineers from creating new innovative software to give their businesses a competitive edge. Unqork frees those teams up to focus on adding value instead of rewriting legacy code.

Unqork Appoints Philip Lacor as Chief Revenue Officer

Lacor brings expertise in scaling and leading global enterprise sales functions as Unqork continues rapid growth

NEW YORK – July 1, 2021 – Unqork, the leading enterprise no-code platform, today announced the appointment of Philip Lacor as Chief Revenue Officer (CRO). Lacor joins Unqork with decades of experience leading global enterprise sales organizations, having held leadership positions at companies including Envoy, Dropbox and Dell. Lacor has a proven track record of scaling enterprise sales functions -- growing teams from dozens to thousands and taking businesses from $30M in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) to over $3B in ARR. As Unqork continues to experience a period of rapid growth and seeks to further expand its global footprint, Lacor’s experience will help drive the company’s efforts. 

“Organizations in every industry are turning to software for a competitive advantage. Unfortunately, the limitations of traditional coding methods mean that enterprises can’t green-light every project -- the ones they do pursue take too long and cost too much to get to market, and technology teams spend the majority of their time patching and maintaining legacy code,” said Philip Lacor, Chief Revenue Officer, Unqork. “By providing a new, no-code approach that allows enterprises to build mission-critical software faster, at a lower cost and a much higher quality, Unqork is incredibly well-positioned to capture one of the biggest markets in tech. I’m thrilled to be on this journey with the team.”

Lacor has experience leading all sales and go-to-market functions including customer success, support, channel alliances, business development and sales operations. Most recently, he served as CRO of Envoy, a leading workplace technology platform used in over 14,000 locations around the globe. 

“This is a pivotal moment for Unqork. We’re going after the $500B a year that enterprise organizations spend coding software and our product-market fit is proven by our roster of Fortune 500 customers across industries,” said Gary Hoberman, founder and CEO, Unqork. “As we look to rapidly scale our operations to meet the demand we are seeing for Unqork, Philip’s experience will greatly help us capture this massive opportunity.”

Chicago’s ERAP was open between May 24 and June 15 and in addition to seeking rental payments, applicants also requested utility assistance through the site. 

“Since we opened our first round of rental assistance grants in March 2020, we’ve seen the need for additional assistance continue to grow and threaten an eviction crisis,” said Marisa Novara, Commissioner, Chicago Department of Housing. “I would like to thank Unqork for its creativity and diligence in creating this customized platform that will allow us to get these funds directly to those who are most in need.”

Unqork Rent Relief gives state and local governments a way to effectively and securely manage ERAP funding and distribute support to the millions of households unable to pay rent and utilities due to the pandemic. Unqork is the only truly end-to-end solution in the market that includes: eligibility assessment, application submission, application review and quality control, payments, auditing, and reporting to the US Treasury and other regulators. Because of Unqork’s flexible nature, the application can be easily customized to meet the specific needs of each jurisdiction while quickly and accurately getting funds to citizens in need, at scale. To date, Unqork Rent Relief is supporting the management of more than $430M of ERAP funding at a total cost of less than $3.2M across all state, city and county customers. 

Unqork’s enterprise no-code platform was built to support the complexity, scale and security that mission-critical applications in regulated industries require, all without creating a single line of code. Using Unqork’s visual drag-and-drop interface, customers are able to build, deploy and manage solutions significantly faster than traditional coding methods.

“We are proud to support the City of Chicago and the Department of Housing, along with all of our state, city and county Rent Relief customers, to ensure that families in need can stay in their homes,” said Cas Holloway, Head of Public Enterprise, Unqork. “COVID-19 has greatly accelerated the need for virtual public services, creating a once-in-a-generation opportunity to modernize the way the government meets the most critical needs of the people they serve.” 

More than a dozen states, counties and municipalities are leveraging Unqork’s no-code Rent Relief solution. In Santa Clara County and the City of San Jose, rent relief funds are being distributed through the countywide Homelessness Prevention System, a partnership between public agencies and local nonprofits, led by Destination: Home and Sacred Heart Community Service. They have used Unqork's Rent Relief application to manage the full ERAP program to benefit the lowest income County residents.

Unqork has a proven track record of swiftly addressing government needs with secure, flexible no-code solutions. Last spring, Unqork supported a number of digitization efforts to help governments support their residents during the pandemic, including the support of COVID hubs for New York City and The District of Columbia.  Unqork partnered with Deloitte to build and launch in one week an application enabling lenders to efficiently process loan requests through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). Unqork and KPMG worked with The Community Preservation Corporation to rapidly build and launch a mortgage forbearance solution to support new challenges in the housing industry caused by COVID. Unqork’s Virtual Government Services offering has enabled government agencies to digitize everything from family benefits to marriage licences, building permits or vehicle registration. 

Before Unqork, this kind of transformation would require teams of software developers and expensive retainer contracts to handle future changes. Using Unqork’s no-code platform, government CTOs, CIOs and their teams can work with the agencies they serve to quickly get reliable solutions to market--and easily make future updates without generating any code.

Unqork Announces the Unqork 2021.5 Platform Update

Unqork 2021.5 consolidates SDLC in a single location and adds industry-first capabilities like API Auto-Documentation while seamlessly integrating with existing tools for enterprise teams

NEW YORK – May 20, 2021 – Unqork, the leading enterprise no-code platform, today announced the release of Unqork 2021.5 to make it easier than ever for engineering teams to leverage the power of no-code for business-critical transformation efforts such as app modernization, legacy integrations, cloud migration, microservices adoption and more. The release consolidates existing SDLC features like application dependencies, testing and configuration analysis, deployments and release management, logging, metrics and monitoring in a single tool in the Unqork platform while seamlessly integrating with all external SDLC tools application development teams use today. The release also introduces industry-first features like API Auto-Documentation, Data Model Auto-Documentation and point-in-time application Rollback. Unqork 2021.5 gives enterprise engineering teams more control than ever to follow SDLC best practices on a no-code platform designed for the most complex, mission-critical applications. 

“As a Fortune 50 CIO I managed more than 10,000 software engineers and know first hand the challenges they face in the enterprise. These teams are tasked with building the defining software products that drive their company’s success, while simultaneously maintaining and patching a massive amount of legacy code, modernizing antiquated applications, breaking down monolithic apps to rebuild in a microservices architecture, migrating applications to the cloud, and on and on. They need a solution that helps them move faster, with higher quality and just generally makes their lives easier,” said Gary Hoberman, founder and CEO, Unqork. “We created Unqork to be that solution, to empower software engineers to do more, and the features in the latest release of the Unqork platform make it easier than ever to develop enterprise-grade software with no-code.”

Codeless Support for Business-Critical Engineering Tasks, Industry-First Functionality

Unqork 2021.5 consolidates the SDLC process into a single location making it easier than ever for engineering teams to leverage the power of enterprise no-code to build and maintain mission-critical software, as well as to support a number of the most pressing business transformation efforts impacting every industry. 

“Since the earliest days, Unqork has been designed to give developers a better, codeless way to create enterprise software. That meant having SDLC features baked into the platform so development teams can maintain all the enterprise-grade best practices they need to build mission-critical apps,” said Nick Gamble, Vice President of Solutions, Unqork. “The SDLC features we have consolidated in this latest Unqork release takes no-code SDLC to the next level by bringing life cycle tools in one place and enriching them with valuable insights, allowing developers to take advantage of the speed and flexibility of Unqork’s enterprise no-code, while adhering to best practices. That we built all these features with no-code speaks to the power of Unqork as a general-purpose development platform, rather than an industry-specific one.”

Unqork 2021.5 includes:

    API Auto-Documentation - a no-code industry-first feature that instantly and automatically documents any API built on Unqork. Traditionally, API documentation tends to be done after the fact, and the moment a change in software is made the documentation is out-of-date. By auto-generating APIs in a consistent, uniform format, Unqork allows application development teams to quickly reuse and share APIs via Unqork’s drag-and-drop approach with the added assurance that documentation is always up-to-date. The API Docs Dashboard provides an auto-generated view of all API modules, enabling users to easily plan and design their applications. As organizations continue to migrate to microservices architecture away from monolithic legacy applications, API Auto-Documentation provides instant documentation of each API a microservice exposes and allows relevant features of legacy applications to find new uses in modern builds.

    Data Model Auto-Documentation - an industry-first feature that gives users added governance through acute visibility into every data model that exists in their environment. Unqork was built with a completely integrated data store and is designed to allow users to implicitly define their data model as their application evolves. Now, development teams have a clean change log over who is making alterations in data models while automatically and instantly documenting all models for preferred use in the future. The result is an ability to develop software with incredible speed while still maintaining tight data modeling control and governance. 

    Application Dependencies - As users begin building a solution, the Application Dependencies Dashboard helps them understand the connections that exist in their environment between microservices, external services, applications and modules. The Dashboard identifies and documents all dependencies so creators can plan for any potential downstream changes or anticipate potential issues. The result is similar to aspects of a service mesh, providing a view that shows how various microservices are related so that when a change is made in one place it's very easy to see what might be impacted. 

    Testing and Config Analysis - Unqork 2021.5 includes features to test and debug configurations, to help creators ensure their application has best-in-class quality:
        Service Logs Dashboard helps engineers identify and address bugs and plan optimizations across different modules and collaborate with fellow creators by providing a rich search interface and visualizations (i.e. charts, graphs) of trends for their most important transactional logs. 
        The Signal Start Node allows Unqork’s no-code workflows to subscribe to system-published events, facilitating automated tasks such as unit and functional testing. 
        The Config Analysis Tool automatically checks for any configuration that doesn't abide by best practices for security, stability and performance,  to ensure that only the highest quality applications are being released.
        Unqork 2021.5 exposes data back to customers to offer native pentesting.

    Deployments, Release Management and Rollback - Once an application has been built, the Unqork Platform helps creators save time, reduce the risk of failure and offers a point-in-time rollback as a safety valve:
        The Module Revisions Dashboard displays an auditable history of application changes, helping creators see what’s changed and who made those changes since the last time they released it. 
        The Release Management Tool helps users make informed decisions about which applications to release by organizing versions and releases in an easily searchable format. This helps identify opportunities for releasing multiple applications in unison, so they can improve release efficiency. 
        Rollback offers a single-click ability to restore a previous version of an application in instances of production issues, changing workstreams, etc.

    Logging, Metrics and Monitoring - Once an application is live, support teams can easily monitor the most important performance metrics in Unqork.
        A Logs Dashboard proactively monitors for any abnormalities, and surfaces errors and slow-performing requests that may merit attention to creators. 
        A Metrics Dashboard tracks CPU, Memory, Network Traffic, and more, providing a centralized view to help monitor an environment and ensure everything is running smoothly.

FOXO Technologies Inc. uses AI-driven bioinformatics and microarray technologies to develop and commercialize epigenetic biomarkers of health and aging. FOXO provides insurers, health researchers and life science companies with laboratory services, microarray design and AI-driven bioinformatics software solutions for generating novel health-based insights into lifespan. 

“The combination of common best practices in the software development life cycle and speed of developing reusable components and APIs to support the user interface that Unqork offers has put us on a track to release and iterate that no competitors could do at this cost,” said Tyler Danielson, Chief Technology Officer, FOXO Technologies. 

"Unqork is a dream. Their platform has allowed us to bring our vision to life while efficiently sorting through the details that are inevitably learned during the development process,” said Taylor Fay, Director of Product, FOXO Technologies. “It’s rare to find a vendor partner that comes to the table with a technology so focused on the ultimate success of its customer."

All SDLC features added in Unqork 2021.5 were built with no-code on the Unqork platform.
